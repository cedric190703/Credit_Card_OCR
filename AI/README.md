In this part we will develop 2 different AI models :

1-CNN model to recognize digit based on the OCR-A and OCR-B fonts that you can find online for free to use this CNN model, and you need to place them in a 'Fonts' folder to use this model. We use OCR-A and OCR-B are the Fonts used for credit cards.

2-AI model based on the Isolation Forest algorithm.

For these two AI model we will use Python's libraries : Sklearn, Numpy or also Pandas.
